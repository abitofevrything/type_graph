Analyzes the source code of Dart applications to find the type hierarchy, then outputs that hierarchy as a graph. Supports [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) as a default output format but can be used with any graph library.

## Usage

Run `dart pub global activate type_graph` to install the package, then `build_type_graph -h` to see how to use the command.
